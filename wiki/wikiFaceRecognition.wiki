== Introduction ==

===EigenFace Algorithm==
*Initial Proposal* was to implement a eigenface algorithm for face recognition
Based on
M. Turk and A. Pentland, "Face recognition using eigenfaces," Proc. IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Maui, Hawaii, 1991.
an Implementation was done in OpenCV ( See Seeing with OpenCV ,Servo Magazine 5 part series )
 Eigenface was performing Poorly with Nearest Neighbour Classifier
= Problems Face =
  * Threshold Value was difficult to obtain
  * Small Training Set
  
* Conclusion: This Algorithm cannot be used for authentication *

===Local Binary Pattern (LBP) : Applications to Face Recognition==

LBP is used for texture analysis , an application of a LBP(8,1) operator on the image(1) leads to image(2)

|| Image (1) || Image (2) ||
|| Image to be Uploaded || Image to be Uploaded ||

LBP Operator Also is Invariant to Different Illumination Conditions

LBP(image(1)) and LBP(image(2))  is Divident in m*n regions
A Historgram is generated for each regions on LBP(image1) and LBP(image2)  and ChiSquare Distance  (H(LBP(image(1)))-H(LBP(image(2))))^2/(H(LBP(image(1)))+H(LBP(image(2))) is computed
and also a Eucledian Distance between Pixels of each LBP operated Images are also Computed
if both fall under a Emperical Threshold , the Face is authenticated
