= Introduction =
When a face has to be authenticated , the Two Input Images which are compared have to be in the same scale , the pose should also be the same. to achieve this the following are done

* Roll Normalisation of the face by Detecting the Eye *

Detecting Eye Cordinates using Centre of Mass(COM)

Rotating Image and Scaling to appropriate predifined size

* Homomorphic Filtering *
Equations

Image=Reflectance*ILLu

Log(Im)=Log(r) + log(ill)

z=INVERSE_DFT(DFT(Log(Im) X HighPassFilter(butterworth) )

Image=EXP(z)


* Wavelet Based Illumination Control *
Funda:

z=DWT(Image)

use HE on(LL)

Scale by factor >1 in HL HH AND LH

Image=InverseDWT(z)
